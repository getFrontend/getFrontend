## Intresting fact about me

At the beginning of 2018, I started developing the [Xiaomishka](https://twitter.com/xiaomishka "Xiaomishka") project from scratch. By the end of the year, the project became one of the most visited and authoritative Xiaomi resources in the CIS, and in mid-2019 one of the most well-known and read **Xiaomi insiders**. 

At that time, my publications could be found in most reputable tech publications such as: *GSMArena, Gizmochina, Gizchina, AndroidAuthority, AndroidCentral, PhoneArena, XDA-developers, Xataka, 91mobiles* and many others.
